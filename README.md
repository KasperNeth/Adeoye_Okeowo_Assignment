## #1 Assignment
Covers a simple http server that serves/renders a static html file if the `url` is  either `/index.html`, `/` or `html` and returns a simple web page of student data. And returns `404` page if the `url` does not match the above mentioned url.

## #2 Assignment
This covers a basic `CRUD` operation using the following request method `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

The task is to create and manage an inventory of items in NodeJs. which allows the user to add, update, delete and view the items in the inventory.

The data is stored and manage in a `JSON` file not `database` and the data is read from the file and written to the file.

The codebase is expected to be `modular in nature`, `return consistent data structure`, `well documented` with `comments` and `proper error handling where possible`.
